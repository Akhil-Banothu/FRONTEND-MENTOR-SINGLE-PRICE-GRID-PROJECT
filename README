## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

In this project I learned to manage with the grid layout especially control of grid system in different view of the device.

Controlling different in the grid layout is especially fun where you can solve the complex pattern easily.


### Continued development

I do want to focus on grid as well as responsive grid when view on different devices.
